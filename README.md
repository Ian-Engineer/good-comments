## How to write good comments

* Programs have two audiences, the compiler/interpreter and human readers
* The program you write should be readable by both
* Although comments are an initial expense, they can save time/money later
* It is important to write comments that are easy to maintain and don't waste time

## Comment Basics

### Comment Types

*Single line comments:
Written above the code they are designated to explain. Indent them at the same level as the code.

    //single line comment

*Inline comments:
used for quick annotation on small, specific snippets of content. Since the comment should only relate to the exact line it's written on.

    const pi = 3.14 //set the constant pi equal to Ï€

*Multiline comments: 
Written above the code they are designated to explain. Indent them at the same level as the code.

    /*
    Normal multiline comment
    Normal multiline comment
    */

    /**
     * Standard multiline comment
     * Standard multiline comment
     */



### Comment Hotkeys (VSCode)

* Toggle line comment (**ctrl + /**) or (**command + /**)
* Toggle block comment (**shift+alt+A**)
* Typing **/\*\*** will autocomplete multiline comment setup



## Comment Usage

### Preface

Perhaps the most typical use for comments: explaining what the code does and why.

### Debugging

When faced with a bug, you can comment out particular lines of code in order to locate where your bug is.

### JSDoc Tags

This is beyond the scope of this presentation. But in summary, using @ and a tag allows JSDoc to scan your code and generate an html documenation website for you. (https://jsdoc.app/)



## General Rules

The following rules are general guidelines to help achieve a code base that is easily readable by a human, easy to maintain, and not a huge expenese.

### Rule 11:
#### Comment often.

### Rule 1: 
#### Comments should not duplicate code.

### Rule 2: 
#### Good comments don't excuse bad code.

### Rule 3:

### Rule 4:
#### Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.

### Rule 5:
#### Explain code that some may consider redundant.

### Rule 6:
#### Provide links to the original source of copied code.

### Rule 7:
#### Include links to external references where they will helpful.

### Rule 8:
